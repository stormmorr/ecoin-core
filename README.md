# ecoin-core
Comparable ecoin mining share generating core in C++. This is the consensus.


Presented here the share generating core of ecoin or ECN  miners of which can be found on the windows 10 app store.
ecoin provides a platform for generating real world assets in terms of coin value, plus a mutable target and visual result.
Together with the required dependencies you can make a piece of blockchain history.
The design works upon a centralised stupid worm mysql database and employs a decentralised group of miners to run the app
and produce shares (a share is found once the visual targeting is perfect enough to meet the contract conditions)
verifying the current transactions and adding one single genesis transaction to the next block for
verification next round mining. The block is found when a share is voted, and classified beyond the current vote max arrangement.
